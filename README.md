# Project Y

Y is a social network that is based on X, which allows people to join by creating accounts. Each user should provide a username, a display name, an email, and a password to create an account. The email address should not link to any account in the system.

After joining Y, users can update their profile info like Avatar, Header, Location and a short description about themselves.

Users can write posts that contain text content, which includes hashtags, and image. Users can like, unlike, repost, undo repost or bookmark a post or a reply.

Users can follow each other. After following someone, a user can view posts of that user in Following tab.

Users can view other users' profile.

Users can chat with each other and receive notifications when they have replies to one of their posts, get mentioned in a post or reply, get followed by other users, or when other users repost one of their posts or replies.
